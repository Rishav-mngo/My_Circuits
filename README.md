# My Digital Circuits

A reading a an amazing book `Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software` by Charles Petzold. A must read for those who love to know the details of how computer works and evolve.
I made few circuits given in the books in a simulator called digital. I finished half of the book and hope to finish it soon.
